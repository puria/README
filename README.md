### What is **INTERFACER?**

The goal of the INTERFACER project is to build the open-source digital infrastructure for Fab Cities.

Our vision is to promote a green, resilient, and digitally-based mode of production and consumption that enables the greatest possible sovereignty, empowerment and participation of citizens all over the world.
We want to help Fab Cities to produce everything they consume by 2054 on the basis of collaboratively developed and globally shared data in the commons.
